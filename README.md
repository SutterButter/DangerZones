## Usage: 
**Warning:** This app has not been thoroughly tested and should not be relied upon for accurate directions. Furthermore the directions are not guarunteed to be completely free of danger, there may be dangerous areas that are not displayed. Danger Zones will only be displayed in Stark County Ohio. Use at your own risk. 

Essentially, keep in mind that this app was created in a day for a hackathon, it is not a release-ready app.

To get directions, first search for locations on the search bar. Then tap a location in the table to select it. Next, click the pin that drops after selecting a location. Finally, click the car icon that pops up above the pin to start navigating.
